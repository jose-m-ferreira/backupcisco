it makes use of telnetlib, so switches must be telnetable to
it expects username & password in order to extract configurations
it copies running-config to the machine by making use of tftp

How to use:
write list with cisco switches to a text file with name 'cisco_switches.list' with one switch per line.

running backupcisco.py asks for input:


Enter User Name: >? 
username credentials for your cisco switch

Password:
Password for Username

Enable Password:
Cisco's enable password for copy running-config tftp: priviledges

Enter TFTP server ip: >? 
Ip address of the machine where you are executing the code. It will use tftpy to setup a TFTP server on your machine,
where the default folder is 'configs'. All your configurations will be backed up to this location.


What it does:
Parses cisco_switches.list
For each ip in the list, 
    telnets with the defined credentials, and elevates to enabled mode
    Executes copy run tftp://<user defined ip>/configs/<ip of switch>.cfg
